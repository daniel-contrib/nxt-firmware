The nxt-gdb-server.py script is initially developed by Nicolas Schodet.

It depends on the following libraries:
 - nxt-python v2.2.x http://code.google.com/p/nxt-python/

Additional Dependencies For Windows and MacOSX:
 - Fantom Drivers from LEGO

Additional Dependencies For Linux:
 - pyusb v0.4x http://pyusb.wiki.sourceforge.net
 - libusb v0.1.x http://libusb.org/

 Currently, it does not work with libusb v1.x; on Mac OSX, it causes segfaults.

 Installation
 ============
 
 There is no specific installation requirements (at this moment). Just run the python script
 in a terminal window.

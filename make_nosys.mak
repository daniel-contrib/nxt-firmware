###############################################################################

# RULES
#	Rules are formatted like:
#
#	TARGET : PREREQS
#		COMMANDS
#	
#	COMMANDS to make the TARGET are run when all PREREQS are satisfied.
#	  - TARGET is the name of the rule.
#			If TARGET is older than any of its PREREQs, it must be rebuilt.
#	  - PREREQS is a space-separated list of other targets which must be completed first.
#			If a PREREQ is a file, its modification time is checked.
#	  - COMMANDS (optional) are terminal commands which are run when all prereqs are satisfied.
#			Each line MUST start with a tab (not spaces!).
#	

# IMPLICIT RULES
#   Make has a few hidden rules for processing common filetypes in standard ways.
# 	If a rule has a prereq for one of these filetypes, but no explicit rule exists to make that file,
#	an implicit rule is created automatically to handle it:
#
#		%.o : %.c									# .o (object) files are automatically COMPILEd from .c sources (if they exist).
#			$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $^
#
#		%.o : %.cpp									# .o (object) files are automatically COMPILEd from .cpp (or .cc) sources (if they exist).
#			$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $^
#
#		%.o : %.s									# .o (object) files are automatically ASSEMBLEd from .s sources (if they exist).
#			$(AS) $(ASFLAGS)						
#
#		%.s : %.S									# .S sources are automatically PREPROCESSed into .s files.
#			$(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS) $^					
#
#		n : n.o										# Binary is automatically LINKed from .o files.
#			$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)
#

# IMPLICIT COMMANDS
#	Make defines variables containing commands for common operations.
#	For c, cpp, o, s, S, the following commands are defined:
#
#	LINK produces an executable from the specified filetype.
#     $(LINK.c)       --> $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
#     $(LINK.cpp)     --> $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)	# Same for '.cc' files.
#     $(LINK.o)       --> $(CC) $(LDFLAGS)
#     $(LINK.s)       --> $(CC) $(ASFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
#     $(LINK.S)       --> $(CC) $(ASFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
#
#	COMPILE produces an object (.o) file from the specified filetype, but does not link.
#     $(COMPILE.c)    --> $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c
#     $(COMPILE.cpp)  --> $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c		# Same for '.cc' files.
#     $(COMPILE.s)    --> $(AS) $(ASFLAGS) 
#     $(COMPILE.S)    --> $(CC) $(ASFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c
#
#	PREPROCESS runs the preprocessor on a .S assembly file to produce a .s assembly file.
#     $(PREPROCESS.S) --> $(CC) -E $(CPPFLAGS)
#
#	LINT runs a linter on a source file. Command-line linters are typically not installed by default.
#     $(LINT.c)       --> $(LINT) CPPFLAGS 

# SPECIAL VARIABLES
#	These variables are defined in the COMMANDS section of a rule:
#	  $@	is the name of the current target.
#	  $<	is the name of the first dependency
#	  $^	is the list of all dependencies (space-separated).

# Common gcc arguments:
#	-B <dir>	Add directory to compiler search path.
#	-E			Preprocess only; do not compile, assemble, or link.
#	-S			Compile only; do not assemble or link.
#	-c			Compile and assemble; do not link.
#	-o <file>	Place output into this file.

# Rules for output files:
#	elf:	binary output of the linker. 
#	bin:	reformatted .elf which can be flashed to the NXT
